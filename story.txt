  I was a person determined to do one thing. I had one goal which was to scroll to the 
absolute last page of the Internet. I don't know what possessed me to have this goal, 
but I started scrolling one day and I never turned back. There was no button to click 
through pages, so I had to scorll. The day finally came where I knew I would reach the 
absolute last page. After many long days of scrolling, I finally reached the official
end of the Internet. This was the message I was greeted with...

This is a strange string of English letters: "dtzfwjwjfqqdxrfwy". It must be a Cryptography I thought. I could not wait to reveal the secret behind this sting. I recalled the Caesar cipher the instructor taught a few days ago. So I try to decrypt this string in this way. I switch different keys and finally when key is 5 the string turn to "youarereallysmart". I thought I found the secret behind.
